## Hi there 👋
My name is Erik. 

I am a Master's student in computers science with a background in Data Science, Algorithm Development and Neuroscience. 
I decided to switch careers to Computer Science after realizing the creative joy of being able to develop my own applications. 

- 🔭 I’m currently creating the application [Cenote](https://github.com/zachariaswik/Cenote).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about the EdTech industry. 
- 👯 I’m currently looking for collaborators on developing Cenote.
